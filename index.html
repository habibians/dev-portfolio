      <h2>Bio</h2>

      <p>I am a test engineer and recent graduate of the Web Developer Track bootcamp at Thinkful. I love helping people
        and have a passion for technology so perhaps you won't be surprised to know that I began my professional career
        in a customer service role as a helpdesk representative. Over time I moved into a software role eventually
        becoming the senior representative responsible for consulting clients on API and Single Sign-On implementations.
        I later became the team lead for that department. </p><br>

      <p> Nowadays I work in research in development for a global
        communications company as a test engineer where I'm tasked to automate quality checks against our product. In
        this role I'm able to leverage my end user intuition with my excitement for programming. I'm a backend developer
        at heart with interests primarily in data manipulation, reporting, and security but I also enjoy teaching which
        requires me to learn things outside of my primary interests. I feel especially creative when I work on Raspberry
        Pi projects because there's often a physical product to admire. I'm less talented at this though so please just
        ask to read my code instead so I can feel good about myself :)</p><br>

      <p> When I'm not coding, I'm either thinking about or playing basketball. I enjoy the game, the drills, the body
        mechanics, the statistics, and predictions. One day I hope to crush my pals in fantasy basketball with the help
        of a forecasting app I intend to create. I also enjoy reading and applying new things that I've learned. I do a
        lot of DIY around the house because I like to work with my hands. Perhaps this is where I learned to be scrappy
        and resourceful. Skills that carried over into my professional career as well.
